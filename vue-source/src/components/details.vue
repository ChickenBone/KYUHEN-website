        Introduction
      </h1>
      <p style="padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        The contest will last 2 months so until (insert end date). Through this
        contest we want to promote creativity and originality with Game One and
        Game Two. We joined forces with a professional in that field who publish
        games for PSVita in order to also help amateur developers to grow up and
        improve their skills with critics from an expert in that field. In the
        past (PSP era mostly, alongside PS3 era), the hacking community was at
        its peak with an active community, forums and legends from the scene
        (DarK Alex, or geohot to name a few) fueled us with magic on our hands
        and raised a large interest into hacking their Sony devices. As time
        goes further, with devices like PS4 and PS5 and the security being
        tougher and tougher, the hacking community activity decreased with the
        loss of important websites like qj.net or pspgen. This contest, with the
        involvement of Wololo, PSX-Place and PlaystationHaX is the occasion to
        light up that lost fire in our community and hopefully raise the
        interest about hacking their device again. This contest is born from the
        will of the community to have one after the recent improvement, and we
        are making it into a reality. But for it to be successful we need you!

        The Process
      </h1>
      <p style="padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">
        The contest will proceed via 3 simple steps: <br /><br />1. Each
        participant will submit their projects into the 4 categories listed
        below. The contest will last 2 months from [add date] <br /><br />2. The
        jury will judge the projects and make their own ranking per category, we
        will merge those rankings to make an overall ranking assessment.
        <br /><br />3. The prize pool will be split according to the prize share
        chart that you can find in the rules and info section.
