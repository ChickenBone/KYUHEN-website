                <p style="padding-left: 4rem; padding-right: 4rem;">The contest will last 2 months so until (insert end date). Through this contest we want to promote creativity and originality with Game One and Game Two. We joined forces with a professional in that field who publish games for PSVita in
                    order to also help amateur developers to grow up and improve their skills with critics from an expert in that field. In the past (PSP era mostly, alongside PS3 era), the hacking community was at its peak with an active community, forums
                    and legends from the scene (DarK Alex, or geohot to name a few) fueled us with magic on our hands and raised a large interest into hacking their Sony devices. As time goes further, with devices like PS4 and PS5 and the security being
                    tougher and tougher, the hacking community activity decreased with the loss of important websites like qj.net or pspgen. This contest, with the involvement of Wololo, PSX-Place and PlaystationHaX is the occasion to light up that lost
                    fire in our community and hopefully raise the interest about hacking their device again. This contest is born from the will of the community to have one after the recent improvement, and we are making it into a reality. But for it
                    to be successful we need you!</p>

Each participant will submit their projects into the 4 categories listed below. The contest will last 2 months from [add date] <br><br>2. The jury will judge the projects and make
                    their own ranking per category, we will merge those rankings to make an overall ranking assessment. <br><br>3. The prize pool will be split according to the prize share chart that you can find in the rules and info section.</p>

                        though.
